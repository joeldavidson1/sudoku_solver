# Programming Fundamentals Assignment - Sudoku Solver

This is an interactive console based program. The user can play a game of sudoku or let the computer solve the sudoku board. 
In order to solve the sudoku board, the program uses a backtracking algorithm. 


All the code is condensed into one file, this was for automation purposes during the marking process. 


In order to improve this program further I would separate the HumanPlay and ComputerPlay classes into their own files
. I would also add further sudoku boards and allow the user to choose which sudoku board they would like to play.
